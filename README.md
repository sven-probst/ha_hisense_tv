# Hisense TV Integration for Home Assistant
# This is a fork from sehaas/ha_hisense_tv and V4n1X/ha_hisense_tv, with some merged changes and PRs.

Integration an Hisense TV as media player into Home Assistant. The communication is handled via the integrated MQTT broker and wake-on-LAN.
Requires Home Assistant >= `2021.12.x`.

## Current features:
* Turn on / off
* Display current status
  * Source (TV, HDMI, Apps)
  * Channel name / number
  * EPG data of current show
* Volume control
* Media browser
  * LNB selector
  * Channel selector
  * Apps
* Read picture setting

TBD:
* Expose ON/OFF as switch
* Expose all keys as buttons
* Enhance EPG/guide handling

## Configuration

The TV provides a MQTT broker on port `36669`. Home Assistant can only communicate with one MQTT broker, so you have to create a bridge between the two broker.

## MQTT

The MQTT broker is secured by credentials. Some TVs (like mine) even require client certificates for incomming connections. I won't include them in this repo, but you can find them online or extract them yourself. See [Acknowledgment](https://github.com/sehaas/ha_hisense_tv#acknowledgment).

Connection shema:
```
+-----------+          +-----------+
| Home      |  client  | Mosquitto |
| Assistant |--------->|           |
+-----------+          +-----------+
                            /\
                     bridge ||
                            \/
                      +-------------+
                      | Hisense TV  |
                      | MQTT Broker |
                      +-------------+
```

The `mosquitto` bridge configuration using client certificates.

```
connection hisense
address <TV_IP_ADDRESS>:36669
username <HISENSE_MQTT_USERNAME>
password  <HISENSE_MQTT_PASSWORD>
clientid HomeAssistant
bridge_tls_version tlsv1.2
bridge_cafile hisense_ca.pem
bridge_certfile hisense_client.pem
bridge_keyfile hisense_client.key
bridge_insecure true
start_type automatic
try_private true
topic /remoteapp/# both 0 <MQTT_PREFIX> ""
```
Replace `<TV_IP_ADDRESS>`, credentials and `<MQTT_PREFIX>` according to your setup. The `<MQTT_PREFIX>` is needed if you have multiple TVs, otherwise you should just use the default `hisense`:
```
topic /remoteapp/# both 0 hisense ""
```

(Optional) If you have multiple TVs you have to replicate the whole configuration for each TV.
The `<MQTT_PREFIX>` must be unique for every TV. For example:
```
topic /remoteapp/# both 0 livingroom_tv ""
```
```
topic /remoteapp/# both 0 kids_tv ""
```

(Optional) This setup uses the same prefix for incoming and outgoing messages. The integration supports separated values. You have to adapt the topic setup accordingly.

## Wake-on-LAN

The TV can be turned on by a Wake-on-LAN packet. The MAC address must be configured during integration setup.

## Setup in Home Assistant

The integration can be added via the Home Assistant UI. Add the integration and setup your TV. During the first setup your TV should be turned on. The integration requires a PIN code from you TV. The PIN will be triggered automatically during setup. This is a onetime step where the client `HomeAssistant` is requesting access to remote controll the TV.

# YMMV

Tested on an [Hisense A71 Series](https://hisenseme.com/product/75-65-58-55-50-43-a71-series/) with mandatory client certificates. `gettvstate` does not return a `state` but can be used to authenticate the client.
